### Hi there 👋

🧑 - I'm an IT student based in Dijon, France 🇫🇷

🔨 - It's been a few weeks that I have inspiration about cryptography and encryption, I will probably code something about that. To be continued 😉

💾 - C, C++ and Python are the programming languages that I'm fluent with. More languages are coming!
And fun fact, a few years ago, I experienced with VBA Excel, which is how I was initiated to coding. I will publish things in VBA Excel, as I think it's a fun and easy way to get into programming.

🔒 - I'm also really interested in cybersecurity, you can expect me to publish projects about that in the future when my programming skills will have improved.

🗣️ - Not only on programming languages, I'm also keen on languages between humans. I'll make sure to provide translations for my programs in the languages that I'm familiar with (French, English, German, Spanish, and maybe soon Esperanto)
