### Hi there 👋

🧑 - I'm an IT student based in Dijon, France 🇫🇷

🔨 - I'm currently coding a minimalistic terminal-based contact manager in C++ 💻, but that doesn't prevent me from working on other things at the same time.
Multi-tasking isn't just for computers, right? 😁

💾 - 

🔒 - I'm also really interested in cybersecurity, you can expect me to publish projects about that in the future, when my programing skills will have improved.

🗣️ - Not only keen on programming languages, I'm also keen on linguistics. Languages are a passion of mine. I'll make sure to provide translations for my programs in the languages I'm familiar with (French, English, German, Spanish, and maybe soon Esperanto)
