### Hi there 👋

🧑 - I'm an IT student based in Dijon, France 🇫🇷

🔨 - I'm currently coding a minimalistic terminal-based contact manager in C++ 💻, but that doesn't prevent me from working on other things at the same time. Multi-tasking isn't just for computers, right? 😁

💾 - C, C++ and Python are the programming languages that I'm fluent with. More languages are coming 😉
And fun fact, a few years ago, I experienced with VBA Excel, which is how I was initiated to coding. I will publish things in VBA Excel, as I think it's a fun and easy way to get into programming.

🔒 - I'm also really interested in cybersecurity, you can expect me to publish projects about that in the future when my programming skills will have improved.

🗣️ - Not only on programming languages, I'm also keen on languages between humans. I'll make sure to provide translations for my programs in the languages that I'm familiar with (French, English, German, Spanish, and maybe soon Esperanto)
